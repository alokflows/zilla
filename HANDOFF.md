## 1. HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT (session protocol)

**On every session start (fresh account, after a limit, after a crash):**

1. Read this whole file.
2. Read the LIVE STATUS BOARD at the bottom — it tells you exactly what is
   done, what is in progress, and what is next.
3. Run the test suites (`python test_fixes.py && python test_interactive.py`)
   to confirm the tree is healthy before touching it.
4. `git log --oneline -10` to see what the previous session actually shipped.
5. Continue from the first unchecked step. Never redo completed items.

**Orchestration hierarchy (fixed, non-negotiable):**

- **Fable 5 = ORCHESTRATOR.** Plans, reviews, decides, talks to the owner.
  Does NOT write implementation code. Has explicit liberty to disagree with
  this document and the owner — it must argue its case plainly before
  proceeding, never agree just to please.
- **Opus 4.8 = RESEARCH ONLY.** Spun up as a subagent only when something
  needs deep investigation (undocumented CLI behavior, security probing,
  library evaluation). Not for routine work.
- **Sonnet 5 = EXECUTOR.** All implementation — code, tests, refactors — via
  clear, self-contained task briefs. The orchestrator reviews everything.
- If the session is running on a weaker model: follow this document
  literally, step by step. It is written so that careful execution of the
  steps produces the right product without improvisation.

**The per-step protocol (mandatory for EVERY step of EVERY phase):**

1. **Before building:** re-read the step's Goal and Acceptance criteria.
2. **Build** the smallest increment that satisfies them.
3. **Verify the output for real** — run it, don't assume. A feature is not
   done until its Verification commands pass AND you have exercised it
   end-to-end at least once (the backends fail silently; never claim a CLI
   feature works without live read-back/transcript proof).
4. **Future-cost check:** ask explicitly — "will this design cost us a month
   later?" (hidden coupling, duplicated logic, a second source of truth,
   anything hardcoded that belongs in config). If yes, fix it now or write
   the concern into the status board under Notes.
5. **Update the LIVE STATUS BOARD** in this file: tick the step, add one
   line to the log (date, what shipped, any warning for the next session).
6. **Commit** with a clear message. Small commits. Tests green before every
   commit. The bot must keep working throughout — the owner demos it.

---

## 2. INTENT — WHY THIS EXISTS

**The one-sentence intent:** a non-technical person should be able to own a
powerful AI assistant on their own computer — their knowledge stored in
portable Markdown on their own disk, the "brain" rented from whatever free
AI CLI is available today and swappable tomorrow.

> THE KNOWLEDGE IS THE USER'S. THE BRAIN IS RENTED.

- The reference user is one real non-technical manager: speaks English, not
  computer-educated, never reads a log, a trace, or an error. But the
  product is **generic for everybody** — zero industry assumptions anywhere
  in code or prompts. A businessman tailors it to his business, a
  headmaster to his school — the difference comes from **conversation**
  (first-run interview → wiki), never from code or config.
- **Zero budget, permanently.** CLI logins only (agy / Claude Code /
  opencode). No API keys, no paid services, no paid dependencies.
- Access to any given model can vanish overnight (login expiry, quota,
  product shutdown). The product must survive that as a config edit. The
  wiki directory IS the product; it outlives every model swap.

**Zilla is a HARNESS, not an agent.** The agentic CLIs already have tool
use, shell access, file access, conversation persistence, skills, and
plugins. Zilla never rebuilds any of that. Its entire job:

```
User (terminal or Telegram) → [shape context, set policy] → agent CLI
                            → [shape output] → back to the user
```

Every time you are tempted to build orchestration, first check whether the
CLI already does it and Zilla just isn't configuring it.

---

## 3. THE VISION — WHAT WE ARE BUILDING

Zilla becomes a **full, standalone, open-source terminal application**:

- **`zilla`** (bare command) → a full-screen terminal UI, opencode-style:
  chat view + input bar at the bottom. Chat with the AI right there.
  Settings screens. Skills viewer. Conversational onboarding — the user can
  literally type "connect to my Telegram" and Zilla asks for the bot token
  and owner ID, then connects.
- **`zilla config`** → interactive settings menu (plain, SSH-friendly).
- **`zilla doctor` / `start` / `stop` / `status` / `logs`** → operations.
- **Telegram is an optional connector**, not the center. It is frontend #2
  over the same core the TUI uses.

Settings the app must expose (single source of truth = the same
`.env`/`settings.json` the core reads — never two settings systems):

| Setting | Values |
|---|---|
| Backend priority order | agy / claude / opencode, ordered |
| Model per backend | from each CLI's live catalog |
| Fallback chain | on error/empty/limit, next backend in priority |
| Voice mode | offline (local Whisper) / online (Google) |
| Web mode | headless (Playwright) / my-browser (WebBridge, uses real cookies) / off |
| Health & alert policy | silent self-heal; alert only when a human must act |
| Telegram connector | off / token + owner ID |
| Autostart | on/off |

**Environment adaptation:** at startup Zilla detects OS (macOS / Linux /
Windows / headless server), GUI presence, which CLIs are installed and
logged in, ffmpeg, WebBridge reachability — and adapts. GUI present →
desktop control allowed. Headless → shell only. Windows → clean stub
errors ("not supported yet"), never crashes.

**Deployment posture:** all development and testing happens on the owner's
MacBook (fast). The client's Ubuntu laptop is a later deployment over
SSH/Tailscale. Once stable on Linux: dedicated `zilla` user + systemd
hardening (see Trap #2 below — that is the real security boundary).

---

## 4. CURRENT STATE — COMPLETE CODE ANALYSIS

Repo: `alokflows/zilla`. ~10k lines Python on `python-telegram-bot`.
192 tests green (`python test_fixes.py` + `python test_interactive.py`).

### What already exists and works (DO NOT reinvent)

| Concern | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| agy execution | `cli_engine.py` | Runs agy under a real PTY (`platform_compat.PtyProcess`). The answer is read from agy's OWN `transcript.jsonl` under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<conv>/.system_generated/logs/` — NOT stdout. stdout in print mode is untrustworthy; this is already solved, never "fix" it with `script -qec`. |
| Anti-bleed invariants | `cli_engine.py`, `docs/dev/AI_CONTEXT.md` | I-STEP / I-CONV / I-CANCEL + per-user lock + global new-conv detection lock. **Violating any of these reintroduces response bleed.** Read AI_CONTEXT.md before touching the engine. |
| Hang protection | `cli_engine.py` | Idle reaper is ACTIVITY-based (a new transcript step = alive), plus a hard runtime ceiling. Do not add wall-clock timeouts. |
| Claude backend | `backends.py` | `claude -p --output-format json --resume <id> --model <alias>`; pinned Playwright MCP attached only on web-intent turns (`autoharness.needs_browser`). `claude_identity()` reads auth status. |
| Backend contract | `backends.py` + `cli_engine._run_blocking` | `run(prompt, conversation_id, *, progress_callback, cancel_event, skip_permissions[, model]) -> (response, conversation_id)`. New backends implement this + register in `_run_blocking`. |
| Per-turn harness | `harness.py` | Trust contract (anti-fabrication), style rules, engine/OS header injected every turn; full onboarding only on new conversations. |
| Skills index | `harness.skills_summary()` | One line per skill from `SKILL.md` frontmatter (agy: `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills`, claude: `~/.claude/skills`). Bodies load on demand. Token discipline is already correct. |
| Event log | `harness.log_event()` | Structured `logs/trust_log.jsonl` on every turn (backend, model, task class, duration). Quota instrumentation is 80% done. |
| Human-in-the-loop | `interactive.py` + `bot.py bridge_watcher` | Agent pauses mid-task by writing `ask_<id>.json`; owner is DM'd; reply written as `answer_<id>.json`; secrets masked and wiped. Pure core, tested. Kinds: otp/password/text/confirm. |
| Anti-hallucination | `verify.py` | Precision-tuned regex gate + ONE corrective retry in the same conversation. Already the seed of "self-correct, never loop silently". |
| Auth tiers | `users.py` | owner / admin / limited. **Approval mode**: limited users' requests held until owner taps ✅. Reuse this UI for skill approval. |
| Sessions | `sessions.py` | Per-user named sessions; conversation ids tagged with the backend that created them (never resumed cross-backend). |
| Scheduler | `schedules.py` + `schedule_parse.py` | Self-healing (retry → give-up → still fires next occurrence), NL parsing ("every day at 9am…"), catch-up after downtime. |
| OS divergence | `platform_compat.py` | The ONLY file with OS-specific code (locks, PTY, Windows window-hiding). Keep it that way. |
| Config | `config.py` | `.env` + `settings.json` (mtime-cached), path autodetection, backend-aware model layer with atomic write + read-back. |
| Installer | `install.py` | Interactive setup + `--doctor` self-check. This is the seed of `zilla config`. |
| Voice | `media.py` | Transcription via GOOGLE CLOUD speech API (free, online) — **NOT local Whisper**, despite what older notes claim. |
| Browser bridge | `bot.py` (`/browse`, `KIMI_BRIDGE_URL`) | External localhost service ("Kimi WebBridge"). Currently assumed present; becomes the optional "my-browser" web mode. |

### The problem child

`bot.py` (2,872 lines) is the app today: Telegram handlers + scheduler
runtime + approval flow + delivery + menus + lifecycle, all tangled
together. The core-extraction refactor (Phase 1) mostly means carving this
file up. This is the largest single risk in the plan — migrate
incrementally (strangler pattern); the Telegram bot must keep working at
every commit.

### Known traps (verify in Phase 0 — do not trust)

1. **agy model handling contradicts itself in-repo.** `config.py` says agy
   has NO `--model` flag (model = display string like
   `"Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)"` written into
   `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`); `cli_engine.py` passes
   `--model` "(agy v1.0.6+)". agy **silently ignores unknown model
   strings** — a typo means the wrong model with zero error. Find the
   installed truth; keep the read-back verification either way.
2. **No in-CLI sandbox (probably).** `docs/dev/AI_CONTEXT.md` records an
   empirical finding (older build): headless `--print` executes tools
   REGARDLESS of `--sandbox`/permission flags. Re-verify on the installed
   versions. If still true, the only real security boundary is OS-level
   (dedicated user + systemd hardening on the Linux deployment; never run
   the agent as root) — and anything "deterministic security" Zilla adds
   must be enforced by Zilla itself, never judged by the model.
3. **agy auth expires silently** (login token in the OS keychain — the
   "3am problem"). The probe primitive exists (`config.agy_reachable()`:
   `agy models` returning real data implies logged in) but nothing calls
   it proactively.
4. **opencode is not integrated at all yet.**
5. **`~/AGI-Brain` (Inbox/Outbox/Bridge) is legacy layout** — owner wants
   one clean Zilla home directory instead (Phase 3).
6. Older docs (`README.md`, `docs/dev/STATUS.md`) predate this vision —
   where they conflict with this document, THIS DOCUMENT WINS.

---

## 5. OWNER DECISIONS ALREADY MADE (do not re-ask)

- Terminal-first full application; Telegram is an optional connector.
- TUI style: opencode-like full-screen chat (recommended lib: Textual —
  free, open source, pure Python). Orchestrator may propose an alternative
  with reasons, once, in Phase 2 planning.
- Core extraction (Phase 1) comes BEFORE the TUI. Owner accepts it takes
  time; the goal is "not suffering a month later".
- `~/AGI-Brain` layout is replaced by one clean, portable, git-init'd
  Zilla home.
- Health is SILENT self-healing: check quietly, fix autonomously, log
  everything; alert the owner ONLY when a human must act (e.g. re-login),
  with a plain-language runbook. No hourly status spam, ever.
- Fallback fires on error / empty output / limit-detected only — NOT on
  long runtime (the idle reaper already separates working from stuck).
- Voice: both engines implemented; a setting chooses offline (Whisper) vs
  online (Google).
- WebBridge: kept, demoted to optional "my-browser" web mode with
  reachability auto-detection and silent degradation.
- Skills: instruction-type auto-approve; code-type need ONE owner approval
  tap before first run (deterministic, enforced by Zilla, not the model).
- No vector DB — grep + the agent reading files.
- Zero budget. No API keys. No paid anything.
- Windows: stubbed with clean errors, not implemented now.
- Dev machine: owner's MacBook. Deployment: client's Ubuntu laptop later.

---

## 6. THE PLAN

Phases are dependency-ordered. Do them in order. Each phase lists Goal,
Steps, and Acceptance criteria — a step is done only when its acceptance
criteria are verified by actually running things.

### PHASE 0 — VERIFY REALITY ON THIS MACHINE (blocks everything)

**Goal:** replace assumptions with the installed truth. No building yet.

Steps:
1. Capture `agy --help`, `claude --help`, `opencode --help` (and
   `opencode run --help` or equivalent). Record: model selection flags,
   print/headless mode, conversation persistence flags, `--add-dir` or
   workspace flags, output formats, approval/permission flags,
   `--print-timeout` default.
2. Test whether agy reads `GEMINI.md` / `AGENTS.md` from its working dir
   (put a distinctive instruction in one, ask a question, see if it obeys).
3. Re-test Trap #2 (sandbox): in the most restrictive permission mode each
   CLI offers, run a headless turn that tries to write a file to a temp
   dir. Record whether the write happened. SAFE probes only.
4. Record login state of each CLI, `agy models` output, opencode's model
   list and how a model is chosen per run.
5. Run both test suites on macOS; note any platform-specific failures.

**Acceptance:** a findings table committed to `docs/dev/PHASE0_FINDINGS.md`;
any finding that changes this plan is raised to the owner BEFORE Phase 1.

### PHASE 1 — CORE EXTRACTION (the foundation)

**Goal:** an interface-agnostic core so the TUI and Telegram are both thin
frontends. The Telegram bot's behavior must not change.

Steps:
1. Design first (orchestrator): define the core API on paper — roughly:
   `core.handle_message(user, text, attachments) → stream of (progress |
   response | ask | files)`, plus session ops, settings ops, schedule ops,
   approval ops, health ops. Present to the owner before coding.
2. Create `zilla/` package; move pure modules in unchanged first
   (`sessions`, `users`, `schedules`, `schedule_parse`, `verify`,
   `autoharness`, `interactive`, `harness`, `config`, `platform_compat`,
   `cli_engine`, `backends`, `media`, `formatter`) with import shims so
   `bot.py` and tests keep passing at every commit.
3. Extract from `bot.py` into the core, one seam at a time: turn pipeline
   (locks, approval hold, run, verify, deliver), scheduler runtime, bridge
   watcher, health. `bot.py` shrinks to Telegram I/O + menus.
4. The core exposes the ask/answer bridge as events so ANY frontend
   (terminal included) can relay OTP/confirm prompts.

**Acceptance:** all 192 tests green plus new tests for the core seams; a
live Telegram round-trip works unchanged (text, voice, file, schedule,
approval, cancel); `bot.py` no longer contains engine/scheduler logic.

### PHASE 2 — THE `zilla` APP (entrypoint + TUI)

**Goal:** `zilla` is a real application.

Steps:
1. `zilla` console entrypoint (installable, e.g. `pipx install .` /
   `pip install -e .`): subcommands `config`, `doctor`, `start`, `stop`,
   `status`, `logs`. These wrap what `install.py --doctor`,
   `start.sh`/`stop.sh`, and the pid/lock files already do — promote, don't
   duplicate. `install.py` becomes a thin alias or is absorbed.
2. `zilla config`: plain numbered-menu terminal settings editor covering
   the full settings table in §3. Reads/writes the SAME `.env` +
   `settings.json` the core uses. Works over SSH.
3. Bare `zilla`: full-screen TUI (Textual) — chat pane + input bar, driven
   by the same core API from Phase 1. Must support: chatting (with live
   progress), answering ask/OTP/confirm prompts inline, a settings screen,
   a skills list screen, a health screen.
4. Conversational onboarding in the TUI: first run with no config walks
   the user through setup; "connect to my Telegram" asks token + owner ID,
   validates, saves, starts the connector.
5. Telegram becomes a connector the core starts only when configured.

**Acceptance:** on a machine with zero prior config, `pipx install` →
`zilla` → onboard → chat with the AI in the terminal → enable Telegram →
same conversation continues from the phone. Doctor reports environment
detection results (OS, GUI, CLIs + login, ffmpeg, WebBridge).

### PHASE 3 — NEW HOME LAYOUT

**Goal:** one portable directory that IS the product.

Steps:
1. New layout (name it `~/Zilla` unless the owner objects):
   `wiki/  skills/  inbox/  outbox/  logs/  bridge/  config/`.
   All paths flow from `config.py` only.
2. Git-init the home on creation; auto-commit wiki/skill changes with
   simple messages (this is the knowledge safety net).
3. Migration shim: on startup, if `~/AGI-Brain` exists and the new home
   doesn't, offer to migrate (move files, keep a symlink or note).

**Acceptance:** fresh install creates the new home; existing install
migrates cleanly; grep shows no hardcoded `AGI-Brain` outside the shim.

### PHASE 4 — WIKI + FIRST-RUN INTERVIEW

**Goal:** the agent's persistent knowledge, owned by the user.

Steps:
1. `wiki/` = hierarchical Markdown + YAML frontmatter. The harness injects
   a one-line-per-page INDEX every turn (mirror `skills_summary()`);
   bodies are read on demand by the agent's own file tools. No vector DB.
2. Preamble instruction: the agent creates/updates wiki pages autonomously
   when it learns something durable (people, processes, preferences,
   domain facts), and consults the index before asking the user something
   it should already know.
3. First-run interview: on a brand-new wiki, the agent interviews the
   owner (who they are, what they do, what they need) and writes
   `wiki/identity.md` + initial domain pages from the answers. This
   conversation IS the anti-hardcoding mechanism — no industry vocabulary
   ships in code.

**Acceptance:** fresh setup → interview happens → identity pages exist →
a later, separate conversation answers a question using wiki knowledge
without being told (verified live). Wiki survives switching backends.

### PHASE 5 — SKILLS, 100%

**Goal:** "make that into a skill" works end-to-end, safely.

Steps:
1. Preamble instruction: when the user asks to make something a skill, the
   agent authors a `SKILL.md` (+ code files if IT decides code is better —
   the agent chooses the form) into the active backend's skills dir.
2. Code-type skills are written to `skills/pending/` instead. Zilla (not
   the model) detects pending skills and raises an approval request —
   reuse the Approval-mode UI in Telegram AND an equivalent prompt in the
   TUI. One owner tap moves it live. Instruction-only skills go live
   immediately. The distinction is determined by Zilla inspecting the
   skill's files (deterministic), not by asking the model.
3. Skills viewer: list (name + description + type + status) in both TUI
   and Telegram menu; per-skill enable/disable/delete.
4. Failure loop (harness-enforced): a failing skill gets
   `{code, error, intent}` handed back to the agent, one rewrite, one
   retry; a second failure stops, explains the bottleneck to the user in
   ONE plain sentence, and logs the full trace for the owner. Never loop
   silently.

**Acceptance:** live demo: user says "make that into a skill" → skill
exists → (if code) owner gets one approval tap → next relevant request
activates it (verified in the transcript). A deliberately broken skill
stops after exactly one retry with a plain-language explanation.

### PHASE 6 — ENVIRONMENT DETECTION + ADAPTATION

**Goal:** Zilla knows its machine and adapts silently.

Steps:
1. Detection module (extend `platform_compat.py`): OS + version,
   GUI/headless (e.g. DISPLAY/WAYLAND on Linux, always-GUI on macOS),
   installed CLIs + login state, ffmpeg, WebBridge reachability.
   Run at startup, cache, expose in `doctor` + health screens.
2. Adaptation policy: GUI → desktop-control instructions included in the
   preamble; headless → shell-only phrasing. Windows → stub errors.
3. Display/audio specifics resolved at runtime, never hardcoded; if a
   genuine ambiguity needs a user choice, ask ONCE and persist the answer
   to the wiki.

**Acceptance:** `zilla doctor` prints an accurate environment report on
macOS; simulated-headless run (unset DISPLAY on Linux CI or a test) flips
the adaptation; no display/audio identifiers appear hardcoded anywhere.

### PHASE 7 — SILENT SELF-HEALING HEALTH

**Goal:** the 3am problem dies quietly.

Steps:
1. Background health loop in the core (piggyback on the scheduler tick):
   periodically check CLI reachability + login (`agy_reachable(force=True)`,
   `claude_identity()`), disk space, WebBridge (only if web mode =
   my-browser), Telegram connectivity.
2. Self-heal what a program can: restart crashed connector, re-create
   missing dirs, clear stale bridge files, retry transient failures.
   Log every check + action to `trust_log.jsonl`. NO messages to anyone.
3. Alert the owner ONLY on human-required conditions (login expired, disk
   full, token revoked) — one message, plain language, with exact recovery
   steps (a runbook readable at 3am), and no repeat alert until the
   condition changes.
4. Usage/quota counters (per backend+model per day, from trust_log) shown
   on demand in Health screens; anomaly = a one-time owner note, not spam.

**Acceptance:** kill the CLI login (log out) → within one health interval
the owner gets ONE plain-language alert with recovery steps, and no
further spam; restore login → a single "recovered" note; routine checks
produce zero messages.

### PHASE 8 — FALLBACK CHAIN + OPENCODE BACKEND

**Goal:** model access can vanish and the user never sees a hole.

Steps:
1. `run_opencode()` in `backends.py` honoring the existing backend
   contract (headless run, model flag, conversation persistence — per
   Phase 0 findings); register in `cli_engine._run_blocking`; add its
   models to `config.model_catalog()`.
2. Fallback policy in `_run_blocking`: if the primary backend's turn ends
   in error / empty output / `detect_limit()` hit, re-run the SAME turn on
   the next backend in the owner-configured priority. The user gets one
   clean answer; the owner gets a log event (and a health note only if it
   keeps happening). Never fall back on long-but-alive runs.
3. All backend/model choices live in settings; zero hardcoded model
   strings outside `config.py` fallback caches.

**Acceptance:** with the primary CLI broken on purpose (logged out or
renamed), a user message still gets a real answer via the fallback, the
switch is visible in trust_log, and the user-visible reply contains no
error garbage. Restore primary → next turn uses it again.

### PHASE 9 — VOICE (offline option)

**Goal:** voice notes work per the owner's privacy choice.

Steps:
1. Add local Whisper transcription (faster-whisper or whisper.cpp binding;
   small/base model — must run acceptably on an i5/16GB) alongside the
   existing Google path in `media.py`.
2. `voice_mode` setting decides; offline mode must never touch the
   network; if the chosen engine is unavailable, degrade to the other WITH
   a one-time owner note.

**Acceptance:** a voice note transcribes correctly in both modes; network
disabled + offline mode still works.

### PHASE 10 — DEPLOYMENT HARDENING (later, on the client's Ubuntu laptop)

**Goal:** the real security boundary, per Trap #2.

Steps: dedicated non-root `zilla` user; systemd unit with hardening
(`ProtectSystem=strict`, `ReadWritePaths=` the Zilla home, resource
limits); autostart; SSH/Tailscale access for the owner; deployment runbook
in `docs/`. Never run the agent as root — elevation is for building the
cage, not for the agent.

**Acceptance:** documented install on a fresh Ubuntu machine; the agent
cannot write outside its allowed paths (verified by probe); reboot →
everything comes back by itself.

---

## 7. WORKING AGREEMENTS (always in force)

- Plan → owner approval → execute. Small reviewed increments.
- The bot/app must keep working at every commit (the owner demos it).
- Preserve the `docs/dev/AI_CONTEXT.md` invariants (I-CONV / I-STEP /
  I-CANCEL, per-user lock, global new-conv lock).
- OS-specific code lives ONLY in `platform_compat.py`.
- Tests green before every commit; new pure logic gets tests.
- No hardcoded models/paths outside config. No industry vocabulary in core
  prompts or code. Secrets never in argv. No paid dependencies.
- Security decisions are deterministic (enforced by Zilla), never
  model-judged — untrusted text talks to the model.
- Never claim a CLI feature works without live proof — backends fail
  silently.
- Keep replies to the owner SHORT and point-wise; they are often on a
  phone. Plain language, no jargon.

### Session log

| Date | Session did | Warnings for next session |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-16 | Full codebase analysis; handoff written and pushed. | agy/opencode were NOT installed in that environment — nothing in "traps" is verified yet. Do Phase 0 first. Older repo docs conflict with this vision; this file wins. |
| 2026-07-16 (later, MacBook) | Phase 0 complete: all 3 CLIs probed live, 208 tests green, `docs/dev/PHASE0_FINDINGS.md` committed. Trap #1 refuted (agy `--model` validates, hard error). Trap #2 split: claude blocks headless writes without permission; agy+opencode execute unattended. agy does NOT read GEMINI.md/AGENTS.md; opencode DOES read AGENTS.md. opencode runs free with 0 credentials. claude = Pro subscription. | Nothing blocks Phase 1. Next: orchestrator designs the core API on paper and gets owner approval BEFORE coding (P1 step 1). Local checkout is `~/Documents/repos/zilla`. |
| 2026-07-16 (P1 step 2, MacBook) | Pure move (no logic edits): `platform_compat, config, users, sessions, schedules, schedule_parse, verify, autoharness, interactive, harness, cli_engine, backends, media, formatter` → `zilla/` via `git mv` (history preserved). Cross-module imports inside `zilla/` rewritten to `from zilla.<mod> import ...`. Root-level shim files (`import zilla.<mod> as _mod; sys.modules[__name__] = _mod`) alias the old names so `bot.py`, `keyboards.py`, `install.py`, and both test suites are unchanged. `config.BASE_DIR` and `harness._HERE` (both `__file__`-derived) bumped one directory level up — they now point one level deeper than before the move, fixed with a one-line comment each. 192+16 tests green; `zilla.cli_engine/backends/harness/media` import clean; `import bot`/`import keyboards` fail ONLY on missing `telegram` package (not installed in this env — expected, not an import-path bug); `import install` clean. | `bot.py` and `keyboards.py` still import the OLD top-level names (`from config import ...` etc.) via the shims — that's intentional for this step. Next P1 step extracts the turn pipeline out of `bot.py` into `core.handle_message`; once bot.py is rewritten to use `zilla.*` directly (or the shim strategy is revisited) the root-level shim files can be deleted. `telegram` package is not installed in system `python3` on this machine — install it (or use whatever venv the bot normally runs in) before attempting a live Telegram smoke test. |
| 2026-07-16 (P1 turn-pipeline seam, MacBook) | Extracted the TURN PIPELINE from `bot.py` into `zilla/core.py`: event dataclasses per CORE_API (`Progress`/`Ask`/`Response` live; `ApprovalRequest`/`Alert`/`ScheduledResult` placeholders) + `ZillaCore` with async-generator `handle_message(user_id, text, chat_key=, auto_title=, skip_permissions=)`, `cancel(key)`, `is_busy(uid)`, `get_user_lock(uid)`. Moved (not rewritten): per-user lock map, `_active_cancel`, `_conv_for_run`, the whole `_run_cli_turn` body (in-lock session pinning, `run_cli_async` w/ progress callback + cancel event, session writes threading `session_name`+`backend`). `bot.py` handlers (text/voice/photo/document + approval runner) now drive `_relay_cli_turn` → `core.handle_message`; cancel taps use `core.cancel()`. Scheduler/bridge/health stayed in `bot.py` (thin `_get_user_lock`/`_conv_for_run` delegates share the core's lock). Progress events are consumed silently in Telegram — the ⏳ Working UI remains time-driven `keep_typing`, so visible behavior is unchanged. New `test_core.py` (29 tests, backend monkeypatched): event sequence, bookkeeping, lock serialization, cancel, error hygiene. 192+16+29 = 237 green; `import bot` clean in a local `.venv` (git-ignored). | ⚠️ LIVE TELEGRAM ROUND-TRIP STILL PENDING — this machine has no `.env`/bot token, so the seam is verified only by tests + import. Owner must run a live smoke (text, voice, photo, doc, approval, cancel) before the P1 extraction item can be ticked. AI_CONTEXT.md §Module map/§L still describe the lock/cancel state as living in `bot.py` — update it as the remaining seams move (scheduler → step 3, bridge → step 4, approvals → step 5, health → step 6); only then delete the `_get_user_lock`/`_conv_for_run` delegates and the root-level shims. |

### Notes / open concerns

- Owner mentioned rotating the Telegram bot token after an earlier leak
  (see `docs/dev/STATUS.md`) — confirm it was rotated before going live
  with the client.
- Orchestrator liberty: if Phase 0 findings contradict this plan, argue it
  with the owner BEFORE proceeding — do not silently comply with a stale
  plan.
- **Scheduling policy (owner decision, 2026-07-16):** Zilla's own scheduler
  (`schedules.json` + core ticker) is the ONLY scheduling authority — same
  architecture OpenClaw/Hermes-class agents use (daemon-held job list firing
  prompts at the agent). Two additions to the plan: (a) harness rule — the
  agent must NEVER create OS timers (cron/launchd/Task Scheduler); recurring
  work goes through Zilla (add when the harness preamble is next touched);
  (b) a schedule-request bridge (same file pattern as the OTP bridge): the
  agent writes a schedule request, Zilla shows the owner the normal confirm
  card, one tap stores it in `schedules.json` — fold into the P1 bridge
  extraction or P5. Also steal OpenClaw's "heartbeat" idea for Phase 7: the
  health tick can periodically hand the agent a tiny checklist review, not
  just probe logins.
